# Micro Fullstack

:maple_leaf: **JavaScript Microservices Development**: Build, test, deploy, and scale microservices in TypeScript.

Here's how to make microservices development quick and easy:

- Develop microservice applications using [TypeScript][typescript]
- Integrate multiple single-page applications on a single page with [Garfish][garfish]
- Develop multiple micro-frontend service applications using [Vue][vue]
- Design a service gateway and registry with [Caddy][caddy]
- Develop multiple micro-backend service applications using [Fastify][fastify]
- Containerize microservice-based applications with [Docker][docker]
- Push containerized applications to [Google Artifact Registry][google-artifact-registry]
- Deploy containerized application images to [Google Cloud Run][google-cloud-run] using their image URL
- Automate cloud infrastructure management with [Pulumi][pulumi]
